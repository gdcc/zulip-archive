<p>I just left the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DHDB24Cp_kzpYqhHCKCtnzOw8_WuLOOONyqJHSsaYM/edit?disco=AAAAtmMT9fk">comment</a> on the proposal:</p>
<hr>
<p>I would like to split up milestone A into GitHub issues that represent future pull requests.</p>
<p>For each issue I'd like to apply our standard sizes (3=two hours, 10=seven hours, 33=twenty-four hours) to indicated how much effort it is needed to get the pull request all the way through QA and merged.</p>
<p>For issues or features that are already completed, I'd like to indicate that it's done and link to issues or pull requests.</p>
<p>Especially for this first milestone, I would like for us to complete it with the smallest remaining scope possible. We've already done a lot! <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>
<hr>
<p>I'm happy to discuss more here.</p>
<p>Partially, this comment was inspired by a question at standup this morning where it was asked how much more effort is needed to use containers for development. I asserted that I gave a demo two weeks ago and that if you have Java installed and are on Mac or Linux, the containers are ready for developers to build and use. For two weeks I've used the containerized environment to test and review pull requests.</p>
<p>I know there's a lot currently under milestone A. I think we should push a lot of it to future milestones.</p>
<p>What do YOU think? <span aria-label="happy" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="happy">:happy:</span></p>

<p>I really like your idea, thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="598112">@Philip Durbin</span>.</p>
<p>Now that I'm reviewing milestone A, with a greater focus on limiting the scopes of the milestones, in my opinion some of its topics may not be directly related to the scope of "Dataverse in containers for a backend (Java) developer". I consider that the environment is already usable for development purposes by a backend developer, assuming that the developer is someone who clones and manages the Dataverse backend repository.</p>
<p>The advantages of pushing images to the registry, as well as auto-containing the Solr configuration in a custom image, are improvements more oriented to milestone B in my opinion, since they are more related to a setup where you don't want to clone the Dataverse repository, expecting all the dependencies and related configurations to be contained in pre-pushed remote images. (The use case for frontend devs, who would have their own docker-compose file in their particular frontend repository, pointing to these remote images).</p>
<p>So first, maybe I'd refine the scope of the milestones a bit, if you agree, or I'd appreciate your point of view on this. Maybe we can discuss this at the next container meeting.</p>
<p>The issue that I would perhaps create for the milestone A, before marking it as complete, is to build the image without maven. But it can be a nice to have, since strictly the scope of A is already reached in my opinion. I would transfer the enhancements that I have mentioned about custom images and pushes to registries to milestone B, and start working in that direction.</p>

<p>Yes! I think the primary things I want are:</p>
<ul>
<li>edit milestone A to be mostly done</li>
<li>move "push images" to milestone B (highly relevant for non-Java devs)</li>
<li>move other items in A to B or future milestones</li>
</ul>
<p>I do think we should discuss this as a group.</p>

<p>We greatly reduced milestone A today and created other small milestones. The recording is up at <a href="https://ct.gdcc.io">https://ct.gdcc.io</a></p>
