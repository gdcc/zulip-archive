<p>Hello Dataverse community,</p>
<p>I work in Library IT at the University of California, Berkeley, and we are doing an accessibility audit of all the software we use as part of our Title II compliance efforts.  We have noticed some issues with the Dataverse JSF UI.  Some of them seem like relatively easy fixes, while others would be quite complex and likely even involve upstream component libraries.</p>
<p>We are aware of the great progress towards the new SPA frontend, and I noticed that in <a href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/11526">issue #11526</a> it was explicitly stated that the fix for that accessibility issue would be in the SPA frontend instead of the JSF one.  We were wondering whether the accessibility issues we found should be filed in the Dataverse issue tracker, and also whether the JSF UI is still accepting pull requests for the less-complex fixes we can identify.</p>
<p>Thank you for the Dataverse project.  I look forward to working together with you to make it even more accessible!</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="931818">@Anna Wilcox</span> ! Pull requests are absolutely welcome. The JSF UI is not retired yet, but I'd probably call it "sunset". We try not to waste precious development resources, but if any important things arise, the JSF UI will still receive fixes and updates. And if the community provides, we'll do our best to merge it!</p>
<p>So if y'all feel like there are some urgent and easy fixes (read: needs a reasonably sized PR) and you'd even provide them, I'd say go for it. Let's hear what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="598112">@Philip Durbin</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="637063">@Leo Andreev</span> and others think.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="931818">@Anna Wilcox</span> hi! We'd be happy to review and probably merge any accessibility-related pull requests for the JSF UI.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday after standup we have a "Triage Tuesday" review of PRs from the community from the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/IQSS/projects/34/views/28">Ready for Triage</a> column of our project board. Often PRs are given a size and put right into the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/IQSS/projects/34/views/23">Ready for Review</a> column.</p>
