<p>I've encountered an issue/bug that's not really important, but though to mention it; if you do a search in the guides and click on a result's link with CTRL (so, open in a new tab but using the shortkey, not using the right mouse click option), then the anchor doesn't lead to the right location of your search result. It's not specific to one anchor, it occurs for multiple searches. I e.g. tested "thumbnail" as a search and opened a result in a new tab (using CTRL+click, using right click and select open in new tab opens it correctly). I've had this issue many times before, but never understood what was happening. It's a minor thing and maybe only windows specific, but maybe others have noticed this before too. Also not sure if it's fixable... <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span></p>

<p>Huh. I'm having trouble reproducing it on Firefox on a Mac but I put it on the agenda for the next (the first!) docs meeting: <a href="https://www.gdcc.io/working-groups/documentation.html">https://www.gdcc.io/working-groups/documentation.html</a></p>
