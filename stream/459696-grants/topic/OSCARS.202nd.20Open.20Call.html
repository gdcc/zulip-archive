<p><strong>Total funding:</strong> ~€16.4 million EUR  (including the first Open Call already closed)<br>
<strong>Funding per project:</strong> Between €100,000 to €250,000 (lump sum)<br>
<strong>Potential maximum of funded projects:</strong> ~160  (including the first Open Call already closed)<br>
<strong>Target user communities:</strong> Science Clusters, wider community (RIs, Universities, Institutes, either consortia, or individual researchers) and beyond. There are no eligibility criteria similar to Horizon Europe, which means it doesn't matter if you are from an EOSC Associated country or not. So, for example, the UK and Switzerland are eligible.<br>
<strong>Open calls launch:</strong> 2nd call – November 2024. Both calls will stay open for 60 days.<br>
<strong>Time for projects’ implementation:</strong> 12-to-24 months (after signature of a Third-Party Project Agreement – TPPA)<br>
<strong>Start of the projects:</strong> Within 4 months from TPPA signature (to give organisations time to hire staff if needed)</p>
