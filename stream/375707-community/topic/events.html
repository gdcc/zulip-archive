<p>The main in-person event is the Dataverse Community Meeting, and the 10th annual is coming up. It's linked from <a href="https://dataverse.org/events">https://dataverse.org/events</a></p>
<p>However, other events take place as well, both in-person and virtual.</p>
<p>In the last year a good number of working groups have started meeting regularly. They are newly listed at <a href="https://www.gdcc.io/working-groups.html">https://www.gdcc.io/working-groups.html</a> and mostly listed in the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_udn4tonm401kgjjre4jl4ja0cs%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York">Dataverse Community Calendar</a>.</p>
<p>I recently revived my idea of listing meetups as well. In the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/c-BM48jiiCA/m/ctQK7KYeBAAJ">2023-12 Dataverse Community News</a>, I wrote, "If you are attending a Dataverse-related conference, you are encouraged to start a thread about it on the mailing list and add it to a shared spreadsheet: <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/huhI8TyE8a0/m/4ey2-TIlAAAJ">https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/huhI8TyE8a0/m/4ey2-TIlAAAJ</a> "</p>
