<p>Dear Community:<br>
The Dataverse Project Team at IQSS and the UNC team hosting the 2025 Dataverse Community Meeting would like to encourage community members and repositories to register for this year’s virtual attendance option:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/497af056-3d1e-4268-a7b7-02d3e2ba04a2/summary">https://web.cvent.com/event/497af056-3d1e-4268-a7b7-02d3e2ba04a2/summary</a></p>
<p>We know that not everyone in our community can travel to attend in person this year, and we truly wish you could. But we <em>don’t want you to miss out.</em></p>
<p>That’s why the virtual attendance option includes access to <strong>workshops on June 10</strong> and all the <strong>presentations, panels, and discussions throughout the week.</strong></p>
<p>We encourage every organization, institution, or repository to purchase <strong>one virtual group ticket</strong> and bring your local community together to participate. Whether it’s a conference room, a cozy office, or a shared space, gather your people and be part of something bigger.</p>
<p>The team has poured heart and soul into creating a meaningful, connected experience. With the reduced cost of virtual attendance, we hope this makes it easier for everyone to join us, even from afar.<br>
We need you there. Let’s make it a week to remember — together.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The Dataverse Project</p>
