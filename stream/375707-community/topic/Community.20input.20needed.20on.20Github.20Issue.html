<p>Hey Community:</p>
<p>Dataverse needs additional feedback on <br>
<a href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/10679">Thumbnails are displayed when a guestbook is activated</a></p>
<p>The issue was tagged as a "bug," but we don't have consensus on whether the community expects thumbnails and guestbooks to function as they are, or as described in this issue. </p>
<p>We could consider configurations at the installation level to resolve this request, if possible.</p>
<p>Do you consider the thumbnail display a bug?<br>
Do you consider this to be expected behavior?<br>
If you're experiencing a bug, what are potential solutions to allow your installation to use this feature as expected?</p>
<p>Please leave feedback by August 10th</p>
<p>Thanks much</p>
