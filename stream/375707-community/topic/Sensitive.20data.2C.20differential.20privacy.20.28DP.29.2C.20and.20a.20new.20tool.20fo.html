<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I know some of you are interested in working with and sharing sensitive data using <a href="https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/index.html">differential privacy</a> (DP), or have researchers in your user communities who are interested in doing so. But learning DP concepts can be intimidating.</p>
<p>I'd like to bring to your attention a new tool developed by the <a href="https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/index.html">Harvard OpenDP group</a>, called <a href="https://github.com/opendp/dp-wizard">DP Wizard</a>. <a href="https://github.com/opendp/dp-wizard">DP Wizard</a> makes it easier to get started with differential privacy. It demonstrates how to calculate DP statistics or create a synthetic dataset from the data you provide. </p>
<p>The DP Wizard team would <strong>especially welcome feedback from researchers in your communities who are new to differential privacy concepts</strong> but are interested in how the tech might help them.</p>
<p>The software is open source, allowing you to run DP Wizard locally and upload your own CSV file, or use the <a href="https://mccalluc-dp-wizard.share.connect.posit.cloud/">cloud deployment</a> option and only provide column names to protect your private data. </p>
<p>You'll be prompted to describe your privacy budget and the analysis you need. With that information, DP Wizard provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://docs.opendp.org/">OpenDP Library</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A plain Python script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text and CSV reports.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please try it out and share your feedback using the in-app tool or by creating GitHub issues and pull requests at the <a href="https://github.com/opendp/dp-wizard">DP Wizard GitHub repository</a>. </p>
<p>We don't currently have an integration between DP Wizard and Dataverse, but it could be something interesting to explore.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="598447">@Ellen K</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="751566">@Cheng Shi</span> have worked on the project, so they may be able to answer implementation-specific questions or have other thoughts about DP Wizard they'd like to share.</p>
<p>Thanks, all!</p>
