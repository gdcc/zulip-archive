<p>Hello, <br>
We are pondering/planning our schedule for when we'd upgrade our Dataverse server to later releases and I was wondering what the release shedule/philosophy was for Dataverse.  </p>
<p>I did notice this:  <a href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/qa/overview.html#release-cadence-and-sprints">https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/qa/overview.html#release-cadence-and-sprints</a></p>
<p>And I found, in the Dataverse Community email list: <br>
<code>...we tend to release when features and bug fixes are done. And we try to follow [http://semver.org](http://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).</code> </p>
<p>That was from 2016 and I was wondering if that's still the case - releases when there's enough new features/ fixed issues?  Do you still follow Semantic Versioning? <br>
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/xt2NtJpZlsk/m/xAPe51BHCwAJ">https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/xt2NtJpZlsk/m/xAPe51BHCwAJ</a></p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
Bethany</p>

<p>Hmm, we have a newish doc called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJwKSUnZtnH_erUsO217_leJQfY8cx96nuUutoQydrw/edit?usp=sharing">Proposal: Dataverse Software Release Planning</a> but it isn't yet open to the public. Let me ask about that.</p>

<p>I imagine it's safe to at least share the "background":</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Often in the past, Dataverse software releases were created on an ad hoc basis. For example, team members established a release theme (e.g., addressessing pull requests and issues focused on a specific feature or system upgrade) or they determined that a critical mass of code improvements had been made to warrant a release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, as the Dataverse Community has grown and the Dataverse Project team have taken on more grant-funded work the limitations of the ad hoc approach have become more clear. Dataverse Community members have asked for greater transparency about the timing and contents of releases. In addition, scheduling the design, implementation, and deployment of time-sensitive software improvements funded by different stakeholders has become necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving from an ad hoc to a planned release strategy will help to address these stakeholder needs for better communication and development planning support.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks, Phil!   This is great and I'll take a look through the document.</p>
<p>And I know what you mean - it can be hard to follow Semantic Versioning.   I'm glad you are trying though. :)</p>

<p>For major version such as Dataverse 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 we've (so far) been tying them to the version of Payara (and Glassfish before that).</p>
<p>I just checked <a href="https://github.com/payara/Payara/releases">https://github.com/payara/Payara/releases</a> and Payara 7 is not out yet.</p>

<p>I was hedging, obviously. In the doc you'll see "Minor release - regular releases that are time based (e.g. every 3 months)". I'd say that's an even more recent summary of what we're aiming for these days.</p>

<p>That makes sense. It's hard to balance getting new things out there people might be waiting for and having a predictable schedule.     The 3 month cadence for minor releases seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Would you favor more frequent releases? Every two months? Or less, maybe every six months?</p>

<p>Also, something new we're trying related to releases is to ask what people want in the next release. Please see <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="375707" href="/#narrow/stream/375707-community/topic/Release.206.2E4.20Proposals">#community &gt; Release 6.4 Proposals</a></p>

<p>Good question - I don't think we will want to update our system more than every 3-6months, so a more frequent release schedule wouldn't affect us (unless, of course, it was a bug fix we needed).  That being said, we are just starting to talk about what we'd like to do to keep up with later versions now.   I'm not sure where the team here will land with that.   If something comes up in our discussions that seems relevant to what you're planning I'll share that info with you.</p>

<p>As you may know, Dataverse uses Solr under the hood and I can tell you it's hard to keep up with how often Solr releases! In practice, we upgrade when we need security fix or whatever, like you're saying.</p>
