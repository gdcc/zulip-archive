<p>At UC Berkeley we're setting up datasets (probably 20 or so) that require a click through agreement prior to accessing the files. We already have these click-throughs in Qualtrics. Is there an easy way to export the questions from Qualtrics and import them into the guestbook for each dataset? Or is copy/paste the best approach?</p>

<p>Hi! I reviewed recent releases, the API Guide, and open issues, but I don't think importing guestbook questions is currently possible or has been asked for.</p>
<p>However, we'll need this functionality via API at least because we are re-writing the frontend as a separate application and it'll need to call into such an API some day. If you'd like to create a GitHub issue for this, you are very welcome to!</p>
<p>As you said, for now copy/paste is probably the best approach.</p>
