<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Who all is using RBAC in S3 rather than programmatic access keys? I have my role including the builtin <code>AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore</code>policy with an inline bucket policy which I copy-pasted from the role which formerly worked using programmatic access keys, but with RBAC I get no S3 access. I do note that there is a "Maximum session duration" which must be set between 1 hour and 12 hours. Does the EC2 instance assume the role each time it needs to access S3? Is there some other way I should define the S3 access policy for RBAC?</p>
<p>Update: testing with the <code>aws</code> binary at the CLI, it looks like the instance _can_ read/write to and from the bucket. Something's off in the Dataverse configuration, and all I really did was upgrade from v5.13 to v5.14, which IIRC enables preference for RBAC.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
Don</p>
