<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I was looking at the Guestbook function, to see if we can use it to pull some statistics from.  I noticed the 'type' column, and that it sometimes has as value 'access request'. </p>
<p>I found out that not all access requests were logged in the Guestbook. After some testing, I think the following is happening:</p>
<p>When you have a dataverse (collection) without any specific guestbooks created, all access requests will be in the csv file. <br>
When you go to a collection that contains a custom guestbook, only the access requests for datasets that have selected this guestbook in the Terms tab are saved in the csv file. So the access request for datasets in this collection that are not connected to the custom guestbook are not stored. </p>
<p>I would think this is a bug, should I open an issue?</p>
<p>Also, since when are the access requests stored in the guestbook? Maybe it was shipped with the 'guestbook on request' feature? If so, are the access requests that were submitted from before this feature also included in the guestbook? </p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Laura</p>

<p>That sounds like a bug to me. Yes, please go ahead and create an issue.</p>
