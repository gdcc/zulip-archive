We have to poke around?</p>\n<p>I think that you do. And there's a few cases here: the author does this _always, and reliably_, the author never does this, or the author has a manual process to do this when they publish and maybe sometimes forgets.</p>\n<p>I think that GitHub is pretty good about always updating the major version tag for their actions. (Hopefully automated, or at least tested; I honestly don't remember.) But me, personally, I'm in the latter camp and sometimes forget. <span aria-label=\"cry\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f622\" role=\"img\" title=\"cry\">:cry:</span> \" -- <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-frontend/pull/550#issuecomment-2485965006\">https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-frontend/pull/550#issuecomment-2485965006</a></p>",
