        "content": "<p>Yeah, we discussed it when we talked about showing the ORCIDs in the metadata block in a different way and if it's valuable to link to an author search. The idea is kinda based on a presentation I saw at Open Repositories this year by Herbert Van de Sompel and his colleagues (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12579438\">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12579438</a>), where they mentioned the concept of \"authorIDy\" (<a href=\"https://signposting.org/authorIDy/\">https://signposting.org/authorIDy/</a>) as part of signposting, I believe. Which is exactly that: being able to search on an author identifier in a repository, which would be a great help in harvesting relevant (metada)data for institutions who wish to catalogue all their output.<br>\nIn the UX WG it came up when we talked about visualising links in the author metadata (link to their ORCID, to their ROR and possibly to such a search).</p>",
