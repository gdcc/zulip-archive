There are perhaps also cases where there are no \"other web pages\", so then the spdx url makes sense. We chose to go with the \"proprietary\" one wherever available, otherwise the <a href=\"http://opensource.org\">opensource.org</a> one or the spdx one as a final option. This because the \"proprietary\" one is the most interoperable, I believe. But again this goes into the issue that there doesn't seem to be any clear guidance on the standards/standardization of licenses in metadata and their urls. I don't think there is a simple and \"correct\" options. Perhaps, we should have a look around at what other repository systems choose as licnese urls (including e.g. GitHub)?</p>",

We initially looked at the \"other links\" inside SPDX but there is a big disparity on what to use, sometimes they have 1 up to 8 links and some of them are even outdated or have been just kept for historic purposes so the idea with pointing them to the root of SPDX is because it is standardized and it includes already the content of the license.

And I think that's also what should be done for future licenses that are added (to use the \"deep links\"), as that's what's normally done by other systems (see my previous comment). It doesn't make sense to me to stray from this community standard. There is no true 'official' standard, but there is a common practice to use the 'proprietary' uri of a license where possible, which can typically be found as the first link under \"other links\" in the SPDX page, it seems.<br>\nI don't know if the communication is going awry here somewhere, because I felt like there was a consensus on this about a week ago to use the deep link (see April 18th). It was just not as simple as the SPDX link, because in SPDX they list multiple options under \"other links\", but I don't think that's a good enough reason to throw the community standard approach out and do something no one else seems to do.<br>\nThere is human work necessary to make the JSON for a license anyway, so I think just making sure the guidance is clear on what link to choose from the list if there are multiple should solve the issue.</p>",
