In our institution we don't have that - the S3 is tucked away and not available to the outside. I've been thinking about using SeaweedFS or Minio as a front, using the internal (read: PB huge) S3 as a storage tier for them. Now yesterday I've stumbled upon <a href=\"https://blog.nginx.org/blog/using-nginx-as-object-storage-gateway\">https://blog.nginx.org/blog/using-nginx-as-object-storage-gateway</a> and am wondering if this would be a better solution to this. It might need code in Dataverse to make the redirects use the proxy, but that sounds doable. I suppose the setup is way less complicated and way less maintenance than a tiered approach. Thoughts? Experiences?</p>",
