We have done this same procedure for the last years without any issues.<br>\nThe merge results in 78 conflicted files, most of them we've never touched on our side. Even the non-conflicted files are partially merged completely wrong, e.g. methods are duplicated. The resulting code is compeletely unusable.</p>\n<p>Looking at the merge conflicts, it seems that git is trying to apply all changes from v6.6 again, although we are already on the v6.6 code base. It claims that the same changes from v6.6 are from another user than the ones from v6.7. Here is an example screenshot of the conflicted changelog.rst.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/M_CeibVyyVwqccl2s7Ic23c_/grafik.png\">grafik.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/M_CeibVyyVwqccl2s7Ic23c_/grafik.png\" title=\"grafik.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"3898x1874\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/53090/M_CeibVyyVwqccl2s7Ic23c_/grafik.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>Is anyone else experiencing problems? Were there any changes in git history?<br>\nThanks</p>",
