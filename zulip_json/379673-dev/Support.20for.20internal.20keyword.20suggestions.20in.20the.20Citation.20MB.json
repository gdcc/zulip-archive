In our Dataverse instance, we've implemented the ORCID and ROR API integration as described here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support/blob/main/examples/authorIDandAffilationUsingORCIDandROR.md\">https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support/blob/main/examples/authorIDandAffilationUsingORCIDandROR.md</a></p>\n<p>This has been a great additionâ€”thank you for providing this functionality!</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re now exploring similar options for managing <strong>keywords</strong> (from the citation metadata block). Specifically, weâ€™d like to know if thereâ€™s any existing extension or feature that supports <strong>internal keyword suggestions</strong>.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to promote consistency and reuse of existing keywords within the instance, while still allowing users the flexibility to add new ones when needed. A feature that suggests previously used keywords as users type would be ideal.</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nAina</p>",
