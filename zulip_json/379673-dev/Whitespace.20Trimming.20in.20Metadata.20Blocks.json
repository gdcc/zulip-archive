Those have been coming back to haunt us during every update of Dataverse when creating a new SOLR schema, making some fields unavailable. To prevent this in the future, we would be happy to provide a PR to add whitespace trimming to the code that parses metadata blocks when they are passed to the <code>api/admin/datasetfield/load</code> API. Can we open an Issue and corresponding PR for that? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"699903\">@Eva Roddeck</span> has already been working on some code solving this problem.</p>",
