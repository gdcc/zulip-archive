In practice, we have - at the moment - three different cases: Datasets that consist only of data, datasets that consists only of software code and datasets that consist partly of code, partly of data. For the first two parts, licensing is sort of straitforward and it would be perfect, if only data licenses (CC-Licenses, ODBl, ..) would be available for data datasets and only software licenses (MIT, GPL, BSD, Apache, ...) for software licenses. It gets trickier for the mixed datasets. Sometimes the dataset is mainly code with a bit of data or mainly data with  bit of code, but in most cases, we handle the license of a mixed dataset by a custom license like <a href=\"https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18419/DARUS-1851&amp;version=1.0&amp;selectTab=termsTab\">darus-1854</a> or <a href=\"https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18419/darus-2134\">darus-2134</a>**.  Also interesting cases are software code that is consists of other software parts licensed under another license. The problem on this custom terms are the missing machine readability of the terms. </p>\n<p>For these cases, it would be perfect, if more than one license could be chosen and some specification of the part of the dataset would be possible (like everything in folder xyz is licensed under license A, the rest licensed under license B). I know that there is also discussion about licensing on the file level, but this could get complicated if there are a lot of files in a dataset.</p>",
