In case of many small files, downloads can be very slow due to how HTTP works. Wouldn't it be nice to enable sending files over the wire as streamable packages? Example: a dataset contains a huge number of small files. To download them all as ZIP we need to download all of the files first, create the ZIP on the server and send it over the wire. Wouldn't it be nice to make use of a compressed stream here?</p>",
