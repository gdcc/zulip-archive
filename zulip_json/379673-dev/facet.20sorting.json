Since these fields are used as strings in solr-query, sorting them correctly in the display is otherwise very difficult.</p>\n<p>I have also seen that there are other similar issues, like <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/8813\">#8813</a></p>\n<p>But perhaps I have overlooked something and there could be an easier way of solving the bug?<br>\nThanks in advance</p>",
