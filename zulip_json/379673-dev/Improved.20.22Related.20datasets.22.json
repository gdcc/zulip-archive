I also built <a href=\"https://github.com/vera/related-datasets-cvoc\">a small prototype</a> using the CVOC mechanism, which can be installed in any Dataverse instance for testing. The prototype includes autosuggest for entering related datasets within the same Dataverse, displays related datasets on the dataset page with clickable links, and automatically infers inverse relationships.</p>\n<p>Since then, weâ€™ve also integrated and extended this in our custom UI (see screenshots). The code is still somewhat prototype/hack-ish and in internal testing, but our implementation is based on a custom <code>datasetGroupId</code> field. This lets us group related datasets in search results and display all related datasets (including inferred inverse and transitive relationships) on the dataset page. Dataset groups are automatically updated whenever \"Related datasets\" metadata changes, via a pre-publication workflow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/hTgjDtK5d7X97RUFsWFXGO0J/Screenshot-from-2025-08-18-16-45-53.png\">Screenshot from 2025-08-18 16-45-53.png</a><br>\n(Dataset page)<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/10FQ8GaCpIV3J-nO67vfZCE0/Screenshot-from-2025-08-18-16-45-12.png\">Screenshot from 2025-08-18 16-45-12.png</a><br>\n(Search result)</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/hTgjDtK5d7X97RUFsWFXGO0J/Screenshot-from-2025-08-18-16-45-53.png\" title=\"Screenshot from 2025-08-18 16-45-53.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1227x453\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/53090/hTgjDtK5d7X97RUFsWFXGO0J/Screenshot-from-2025-08-18-16-45-53.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/10FQ8GaCpIV3J-nO67vfZCE0/Screenshot-from-2025-08-18-16-45-12.png\" title=\"Screenshot from 2025-08-18 16-45-12.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1224x436\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/53090/10FQ8GaCpIV3J-nO67vfZCE0/Screenshot-from-2025-08-18-16-45-12.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
