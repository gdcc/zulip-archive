Here's a thought: in the SPI package, we could add an OpenAPI spec that would define the interface the external service must implement and an exporter plugin may use with e.g. Microprofile/JaxRs Rest Client. We could even add an interface / abstract class for the methods to implement in the exporter plugin (basically being an API wrapper). It should be possible to add the OpenAPI annotations there and generate the spec from it.</p>",
