We have noticed some issues with the Dataverse JSF UI.  Some of them seem like relatively easy fixes, while others would be quite complex and likely even involve upstream component libraries.</p>\n<p>We are aware of the great progress towards the new SPA frontend, and I noticed that in <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/11526\">issue #11526</a> it was explicitly stated that the fix for that accessibility issue would be in the SPA frontend instead of the JSF one.  We were wondering whether the accessibility issues we found should be filed in the Dataverse issue tracker, and also whether the JSF UI is still accepting pull requests for the less-complex fixes we can identify.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the Dataverse project.  I look forward to working together with you to make it even more accessible!</p>",

The JSF UI is not retired yet, but I'd probably call it \"sunset\". We try not to waste precious development resources, but if any important things arise, the JSF UI will still receive fixes and updates. And if the community provides, we'll do our best to merge it!</p>\n<p>So if y'all feel like there are some urgent and easy fixes (read: needs a reasonably sized PR) and you'd even provide them, I'd say go for it. Let's hear what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"598112\">@Philip Durbin</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"637063\">@Leo Andreev</span> and others think.</p>",
