I've had a Rocky 9 dataverse-ansible branch waiting for a while now, because on each run I get (different) IT failures. Same OpenJDK version, same Payara5, same develop branch, different underlying system libraries. Arguably, part of integration testing is to determine whether there might be versioning problems with said libraries, but... I'm not certain on the best way to proceed.</p>",
