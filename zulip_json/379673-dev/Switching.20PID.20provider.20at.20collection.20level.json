In a future version could Dataverse allowÂ <strong>collection admins</strong>Â (not just superusers) to choose theÂ <strong>PID provider</strong>Â (e.g., DOI vs PermaLink)Â <strong>for their own collections</strong>â€”at least forÂ <strong>drafts</strong>? This would let our stewards follow local policy without breaking our collection structure. What do you think ? If its possible to be considered is it best to open aÂ <strong>GitHub issue</strong>?</p>",
