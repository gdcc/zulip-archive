        "content": "<p>As Balazs points out, the import is a bit tricky the moment you allow all kinds of RO-Crates (with more metadata than what can be mapped one on one). We've been thinking of creating a general ro-crate metadata importer for a while (my colleague <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"655610\">@Ozgur Karadeniz</span>  made one of the exporters that's currently available), but after some meetings with other Dataverse installations on how an importer would work, I think there's some more brainstorming necessary on what to do with the non-mappable metadata, and what happens with a following export if you don't discard that non-mappable metadata or if you edit the mapped metadata in Dataverse. Also, RO-Crate can contain files in structures that aren't compatible with the folder structuring in Dataverse, which complicates things if you want to import a full zip RO-Crate even further.<br>\nIn other words, we would also be very interested in such an importer and would love to discuss what the best way of its functioning would be. Because for an ro-crate importer with extra metadata to work, we need to look at the entire upload, import and export flow. Maybe something to involve the people from the ro-crate consortium in as well, to get their input on the best way to do this.</p>",

Do you mean the dataset–subdataset relationship in an RO-Crate?</p>\n<p>In our ARP case, when you upload a .zip file containing your files in a directory structure, we consider each directory a subdataset. In AROMA, you can associate metadata with each subdataset just as you would with individual files. However, all of this is contained within the RO-Crate and is not reflected in Dataverse, of course, since Dataverse has no concept of subdatasets (and directories).</p>\n<p>We could use collections and subcollections for this in Dataverse, but I think that would really stretch the current data model.</p>",

That one contains information on the file structure and descriptive metadata on a file level too. But what if you then delete a file in the dataset in Dataverse, the uploaded RO-Crate won't be updated, and if someone downloads the entire thing afterwards, the leftover ro-crate won't make sense as there's metadata there on a file that is no longer in there. And that again just one issue. Also, how easy is it to make a 'leftover' RO-Crate, would it be better to just map &amp; store the orginal one as a file too, but then what if you change the description in Dataverse, the ro-crate will have a different description and a new export will then have two contradicting metadata elements in there. There a bunch of considerations to make. The easiest option would be to discard any information that's not mapable, but I don't think that necessarily the 'right' option, as it could mean losing a lot of data.</p>",
