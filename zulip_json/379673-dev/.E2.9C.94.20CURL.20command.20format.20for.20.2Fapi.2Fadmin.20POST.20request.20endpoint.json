This is not working.</p>\n<p>And I have tried with -d and pass the dictionary directly: curl -H \"X-Dataverse-key: $API_TOKEN\" -X POST localhost:8080/api/admin/authenticatedUsers -d $TEST_AUTH_USER</p>\n<p>I'm probably doing a mistake in the command,<br>\nThanks in advance for your help,<br>\nregards</p>",
