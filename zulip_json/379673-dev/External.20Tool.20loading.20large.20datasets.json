In our Dataverse instance, we have a few survey datasets that total to &gt; 500MB of data. </p>\n<p>These datasets load just fine while using the Data Explorer (Scholar's Portal's external tool used to view and edit dataset) in Firefox. However using Chrome, the dataset is unable to send the tabular data to the external tool. This was verified using <a href=\"http://hoppscotch.io\">hoppscotch.io</a>, the online alternative to Postman. In Firefox, using Hoppscotch to query the datafile api url (e.g. <a href=\"https://borealisdata.ca/api/v1/access/datafile/892444\">https://borealisdata.ca/api/v1/access/datafile/892444</a>) returns the tabular data as expected. In Chrome, even though the URL resolves successfully with a 200 code, an empty result is returned. </p>\n<p>This (at least to me) to be obviously a Chrome issue, but I just wanted to bring it your attention.</p>",
