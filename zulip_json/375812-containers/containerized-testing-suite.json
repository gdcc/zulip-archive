        "content": "<p>Hi Philip. Thank you so much for replying. In our use case, we decided to go with Playwright in Java for a multitude of reasons that include some of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Neither Selenium nor Cypress are backed by large enterprise organizations. In the long run, it makes sense to stick with a framework that has corporate backing like Playwright does with Microsoft. Because it is used extensively internally, we feel it would have a better chance of being maintained in the long run instead of jumping around with testing suites. Playwright also gets a lot wider support when it comes to browsers.</li>\n<li>We have multiple Java developers employed here at RDMC, it makes more sense for us in the org side of things to ask a Java developer to maintain/update tests than ask them to work on a JavaScript testing suite</li>\n<li>Since the main Dataverse repository is in Java, Playwright is very easily integrated into Java as say a maven profile. Since the new dataverse-frontend repo is in JavaScript and is using Playwright iirc, if we need to in the future, we can translate over these Playwright tests without a lot of friction.</li>\n</ol>",
