Regarding editing <code>setup-all.sh</code>... in order for Leonid (or anyone) to use the edited version (with a new <code>--container</code> flag or whatever), he'd have to wait for the next release for new alpha images to be published, right? Because setup-all is in the configbaker image. Otherwise, he'd have to rebuild the configbaker image, which is a complication I'd like to avoid for some trying to do a demo or eval. Am I thinking about this wrong? Maybe we should stick with the idea of making brief use of <code>--insecure</code>.</p>",
