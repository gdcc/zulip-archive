Previously, it wasnâ€™t possible to gather logs because the action was composite-based and couldnâ€™t run post actions. This implementation migrates to a Node-based backend, which allows post actions and, in my opinion, offers a more flexible solution.</p>\n<p>Another addition is the ability to enable S3 storage, currently limited to LocalStack. This feature provides two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide the raw JVM arguments.</li>\n<li>Use pre-defined presets like <code>localstack</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The implementation of this feature has been quite challenging. The MicroProfile directory-based approach previously implemented didnâ€™t work unfortunately. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"598183\">@Oliver Bertuch</span> Iâ€™m not an expert in Payara, but it seems that the Dataverse instance doesnâ€™t recognize the <code>secrets</code>. Currently, I simply manipulate the compose YAML at runtime, which may not be the most elegant solution, but it works.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve added tests to verify the addition of JVM arguments and a small Python test suite to ensure that functionalities like S3 storage are functioning correctly.</p>\n<p>It would be great if someone could review this, as Iâ€™d like to update the action for use in my other libraries, which partially depend on S3 uploads. Leaving it untested in the CI doesnâ€™t feel right.</p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s the pull request:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-action/pull/18\">https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-action/pull/18</a></p>",
