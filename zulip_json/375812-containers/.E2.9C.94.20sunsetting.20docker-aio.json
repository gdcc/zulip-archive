But I think your idea about deleting, and going to git history if necessary, may be the way to go. The main point of docker-dcm was \"dataverse configured for a DCM/RSAL\"; bringing it in to this repo might have a bunch of \"dangling references\" to the dataverse repo. I'd also guess there have been changes in how to configure dataverse that docker-dcm / DCM/RSAL in general haven't kept up with.\"</p>\n<p>I think he's right. We should probably just delete both docker-aio and docker-dcm and simply go back to git history if we want those old scripts.</p>",
