Come one, come all! Please bring your passion for Docker and all things containers! <span aria-label=\"happy\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"happy\">:happy:</span> </p>\n<p>I'm planning on suggesting that we use this <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"375812\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/375812-containers\">#containers</a> stream to communicate between meetings.</p>\n<p>There's no need to wait for the kickoff meeting. Please go ahead and create a new topic in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"375812\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/375812-containers\">#containers</a> stream if you like.</p>\n<p>In this \"kickoff meeting\" topic, please feel free to RSVP, or suggest something you'd like to discuss at the kickoff meeting. Oh and please spread the word! Thanks! <span aria-label=\"rocket\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f680\" role=\"img\" title=\"rocket\">:rocket:</span></p>",

Adding docs about how to create good working reverse proxies for Dataverse certainly is in scope, but then we probably need to add HAProxy, Traefik, NGINX, Apache and some more cloud vendor specifics. Maybe it helps to provide general docs and have some example configs around.</p>",

What's left is that we communicate with it over a lightweight protocol, it's loosly coupled and that it kind of only serves one purpose. Personally I find it hard to speak of \"microservices\" here.
