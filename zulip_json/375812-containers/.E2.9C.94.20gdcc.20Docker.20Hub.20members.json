I just created a second Docker Hub account that matches my Harvard email so I could accept the invitation.</p>\n<p>We might have a problem, however. We can only have three members of the gdcc org with the free plan. When I try to invite more members I see \"Your organization has met the seat limit for Docker Free Team. Upgrade your subscription to add seats and invite more members.\"</p>\n<p>Here's a screenshot for more context:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/lNyUP08pSrOat2x1s9ngQYvL/Screen-Shot-2023-03-10-at-10.39.48-AM.png\">Screen-Shot-2023-03-10-at-10.39.48-AM.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/lNyUP08pSrOat2x1s9ngQYvL/Screen-Shot-2023-03-10-at-10.39.48-AM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-03-10-at-10.39.48-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/53090/lNyUP08pSrOat2x1s9ngQYvL/Screen-Shot-2023-03-10-at-10.39.48-AM.png\"></a></div><p>To prevent having a bus number of one (just Oliver), I'm glad there's another human in the loop now. And for CI I imagine we'll use dataversebot so that's good too. But are we happy with situation? Two humans and a bot? At the very least, we can share around the dataversebot password. Or we could try to find money for a paid plan.</p>\n<p>(By the way, we also have an iqss org on Docker Hub that I created long ago. The math is odd but 4 of 3 seats are filled by me, Oliver, dataversebot, and a Red Hat intern (hi Charles!) from the OpenShift work years ago.)</p>",
