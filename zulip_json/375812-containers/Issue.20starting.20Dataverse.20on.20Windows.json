        "content": "<p>Hi team,</p>\n<p>I'm having trouble starting the platform on my main machine (Windows). Until last week, everything was working fine on my local branch, although I hadn't updated it in quite some time. I had to switch branches to run some tests, so I took the opportunity to update the repository. Since then, I haven't been able to get the platform running on any branch, even when trying to revert to a previous commit. A teammate has been helping me, but we haven't been able to pinpoint the issue.</p>\n<p>I've made sure to clean everything up (deleted containers and images, updated Docker, etc.) and tried a fresh setup from scratch, but it still doesn't work. When I run <code>docker-compose up</code>, I can see the usual Payara page for a while, but eventually, I always end up with the \"Page Not Found\" error from Dataverse or a generic error saying the site can't be reached.</p>\n<p>I also followed the steps outlined in the <a href=\"https://preview.guides.gdcc.io/en/develop/developers/windows.html\">Windows Developer Guide</a>, including installing <code>jq</code> and configuring Git to use LF for line endings, but the problem persists.</p>\n<p>I'd really appreciate any help or suggestions to resolve this issue. Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/cJ8CfNEpmNqcHBDaNdupEvSu/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-08-21-154703.png\">Captura-de-pantalla-2024-08-21-154703.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/cJ8CfNEpmNqcHBDaNdupEvSu/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-08-21-154703.png\" title=\"Captura-de-pantalla-2024-08-21-154703.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"1720x1392\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/53090/cJ8CfNEpmNqcHBDaNdupEvSu/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-08-21-154703.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
