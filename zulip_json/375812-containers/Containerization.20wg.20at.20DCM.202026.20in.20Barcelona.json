I am Mahendra, tech lead at <a href=\"https://www.sciencespo.fr/cdsp/fr/\">CDSP</a>, SciencesPo Paris and we have been using Dataverse for a while. We are exploring the migration of our instance on k8s cluster and I did not find any Helm chart to be able to deploy Dataverse on k8s. I saw a repo with Kustomize but there is no recent activity on the repo. I would like to know if there is any WG on creating a Helm chart for Dataverse and if there is no, is there any interest within the community to make one? I have a quite some experience in writing Helm charts and I am happy to work with the community if there is any interest. Please let me know. Thanks!!</p>",
