(this is dataverse 6.6, but I think the change was introduced in 6.0)  It looks exactly like this:  <a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/test\">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/test</a></p>\n<p>It's not customized to match our site and we were wondering what the recommendation is for working with these files?  Should we customize them ourselves, or is there a different way people handle 404's? </p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nBethany</p>",
