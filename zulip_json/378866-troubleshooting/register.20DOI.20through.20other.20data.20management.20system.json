As far as I know, by default dataverse generate DOI by itself . If you want to generate PID from external service, you have to ovrride the default <code>generatePid</code> method by, for example, sending a request to a HTTP endpoint and return the PID generated by your management system. There is no configuration option for this so you have to write some Java code.</p>",
