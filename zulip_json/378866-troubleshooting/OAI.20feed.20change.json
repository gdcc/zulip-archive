So is it in the plan to eventually include dc:rights in the oai_dc feed? We are trying to figure out a way to designate records as not open access, or restricted just to asu affiliates so that the feed to Primo can recognize it and also mark them that way. I think Primo requires the oai_dc format. Is there a way to add the dc:rights field to the oai_dc feed manually in the dataverse code?</p>",
