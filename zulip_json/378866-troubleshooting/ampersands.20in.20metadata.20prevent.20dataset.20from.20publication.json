Yes there's been lots of discussion and solutions implemented to address this in a few ways. </p>\n<p>That bit of xml you posted looks like metadata in the DataCite schema. The GitHub issue at <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/3328\">https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/3328</a> was about how special characters in certain metadata fields were preventing publishing when publishing involves registering DOIs from DataCite and the pull request at <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/pull/7798\">https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/pull/7798</a> addressed this. That fix was released with Dataverse 5.5.</p>\n<p>Is the repository you're using using a version of Dataverse that's earlier than 5.5?</p>",
