        "content": "<p>hi there .. I admit I haven't done much with the OAI feed other than just make it available for our LSP folks to grab. However, a while ago we did set up a rule in Primo that looks at one of the fields exported and designates it as \"asu affiliates only\". We recently noticed that isn't happening anymore. We had originally used the \"Kind of Data\" field in the dataset, which I believe mapped to \"dc:type\" in the feed. From the Primo side, if the dc:type field showed \"asu-affiliates-only\" we did not add the open access icon. I'm noticing now that the dataset has a \"Date Type\" field but I'm not seeing the \"Kind of Data\" field anywhere anymore. Is my memory failing me (again) .. was there a \"Kind of Data\" field, and did it perhaps change or go away? Or, did I somehow mess up the schema and/or the OAI feed and make it disappear? We are on v6.5 and I've always followed the published instructions for updating the solr schema, at least I think I have, and we did recently regenerate the OAI feed for a different issue. Any assistance is truly appreciated in untangling this one!</p>",
