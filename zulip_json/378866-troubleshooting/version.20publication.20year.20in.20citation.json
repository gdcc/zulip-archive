In the future we'd probably try to have an option so willing installation could use the major version's year instead of the first publication year, but I wanted to know the reason for the current implementation first <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
