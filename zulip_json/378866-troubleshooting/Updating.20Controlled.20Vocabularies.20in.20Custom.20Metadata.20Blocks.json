Usually the steps to do that are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pass the updated metadata block to Dataverse via the <code>/api/admin/datasetfield/load</code> API endpoint</li>\n<li>Update the SOLR schema using the <a href=\"http://update-fields.sh\">update-fields.sh</a> script and reloading the schema</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First Question: Am I right to assume that if I only add an entry to my controlled vocabulary, I can skip step 2, since the SOLR schema isn't affected by this?</p>\n<p>Second (unrelated) Question: Assuming, purely hypothetically of course, that I want to fix a typo in the Value column of a controlled vocabulary entry. What is the safest way to do so? I have only used the Value column and have not used identifiers for the CV entries. Is that what identifiers are for or should I have used identifiers in the first place so that I could now edit the Values instead?</p>",
