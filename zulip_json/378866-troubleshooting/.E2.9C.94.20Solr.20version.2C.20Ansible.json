However, when I create a dataset, it does not show up in the UI. It appears that SolrR does not work properly, in view of the numerous errors on solr.log (Unable to create core [collection1] ...).</p>\n<p>It took me some time to realize that maybe my installed version of solr, which is 9.4.1, is not the right one. Since the recommended one is 9.8.1 in the release notes, should I upgrade Solr and will it solve the above issue?</p>",
