I'm not clear what effect that would have on the software running, but just wanted to check. </p>\n<p>Here's the install of it in 6.8 - so it seems like it's still useful?  <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/blob/d63a7b1b60d1e96a592745cc26b829c48fe7f7cc/scripts/installer/as-setup.sh#L145\">https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/blob/d63a7b1b60d1e96a592745cc26b829c48fe7f7cc/scripts/installer/as-setup.sh#L145</a></p>\n<p>The instructions here do not propogate it forward during the upgrade, though.
