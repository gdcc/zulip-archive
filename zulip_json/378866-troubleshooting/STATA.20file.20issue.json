I'm guessing, based on this message, that the file is somehow corrupt?   I don't have access to STATA to read it, but did write a quick python script and that showed this message: </p>\n<p>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x82 in position 16: invalid start byte</p>\n<p>Any advice?   <br>\nThanks!</p>",
