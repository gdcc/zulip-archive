After configuring the Postfix on this server, I tried, and the test emails were delivered successfully. I am using the <strong>smtp.office365.com</strong> as the SMTP host. I have provided these details while installing. But the emails are not delivered to the email inbox once you try for forgot password, email verification, etc. Could you please help me to resolve the issue with the email services? What additional configurations are required if I use Office365 as an SMTP server?</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to hearing from you. I appreciate your help in advance.</p>",
