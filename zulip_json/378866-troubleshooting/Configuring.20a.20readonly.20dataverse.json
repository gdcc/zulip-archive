The research project whose data is stored in the dataverse is coming to an end. So we want to keep our users from uploading new data from a specific point in time forward. But the instance should be preserved in its current state. We would also like to preserve<br>\nuser permissions and groups. Access and download of datasets should still be possible for all users.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make that feasible?</p>\n<p>I thought of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>setting file upload size to 0KB (couldn't find a way to do that)</li>\n<li>setting storage quotas (feature not available in current version)</li>\n<li>setting the whole dataverse into a readonly state somehow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is any of that possible in our used dataverse version, or can anyone think of a way to deactivate file upload without messing with the user permissions?</p>\n<p>Thank you<br>\nEva</p>",

But perhaps you could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put a warning next to the username (changing a little bit the code) warning that the system is read-only.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the edit / save dataset and dataverse buttons  (changing a little bit the code).<br>\nTo have more security and avoid modifications using the API:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make the directory or file system where the files are stored read-only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Changing the pid configuration in the domain.xml configuration file to avoid changes in the pid provider (doi, handle, ....) with wrong urls/users/passwords.</li>\n</ul>",
