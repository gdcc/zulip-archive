We have set up a <a href=\"https://dataverse.uliege.be/\">dataverse for our University</a> and we want to get harvested by others. We have enabled the \"harvesting server\" and created a few sets and it works, we are harvested by some other repositories. Nevertheless, we have an issue, the <a href=\"https://dataverse.uliege.be/oai\">https://dataverse.uliege.be/oai</a> gives an internal error while the <a href=\"https://dataverse.uliege.be/oai?verb=Identify\">https://dataverse.uliege.be/oai?verb=Identify</a> works fine (and we have been harvested so it seems to work). Do you know the origin of the error and how to solve it ? The people of OpenAIRE asked me to look into it to be able to get harvested. I am not a developper, just a data manager so do not hesitate to explain it to me with lots of details :) <br>\nThank you !<br>\nLyne</p>",

Welcome to the Dataverse community!</p>\n<p>You seem to be running Dataverse 5.11.1 according to <a href=\"https://dataverse.uliege.be/api/info/version\">https://dataverse.uliege.be/api/info/version</a></p>\n<p>I know we put in a fix at <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/10205\">#10205</a> for Dataverse 6.2 that eliminated similar errors. I think upgrading will resolve the error for you.
