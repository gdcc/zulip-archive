Am I missing a new setting/configuration, or is this a bug? <br>\nThese are the steps I followed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new dataverse</li>\n<li>Set the fields 'Series' and 'related material' to hidden by unchecking the checkboxes. </li>\n<li>Click done.</li>\n<li>Click 'save changes'.</li>\n<li>Add a dataset. I expected these fields not to be visible when creating a new one, but I still see them. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nLaura</p>",
