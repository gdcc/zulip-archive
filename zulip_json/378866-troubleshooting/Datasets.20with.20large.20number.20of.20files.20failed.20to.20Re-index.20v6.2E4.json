We run re-index on a separate server which is not part of Production workload. While re-indexing was stuck Payara server got stuck too and app was unavailable. It ran for hours and 1 time Payara server crashed and restarted with OutofMemory error and other time Payara server did not come back after crash.  <br>\nI had to manually set <code>indextime</code> of these 2 datasets in DB to proceed with Re-index of other datasets. Last time on 6.2 upgrade it took a while to re-index but we did not run into issue with frozen server.<br>\nFirst dataset has 1057 files with size 321G on disk<br>\nSecond dataset 2872 files with 84G size</p>",
