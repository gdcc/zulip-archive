Three is also another change that we donÂ´t have any idea why it is changed?

        "content": "<p>Just to clarify, the support for the extended iso639-3 list of languages was added in the citation block update in Dataverse 6.4. No changes were made in 6.5, to the best of my knowledge. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"760572\">@Steven Winship</span>  may be able to give a better answer, as the author of the PR 10762. But my best answer would be that the goal was to support the full iso369-3 list (there were multiple requests from the community to that extent). The main, preferred names of a few languages - such as the ones listed above - had changed between iso369-2 and -3. So all such cases were reviewed manually and we made the best effort to make sure all the previously known designations of the affected languages were still supported (this was achieved by supplying all such names as \"alternates\"). <br>\nOne super important part is to make sure you didn't skip the citation block update prior to that one. The test is to confirm that all your existing language control vocab. values have non-NULL identifiers; for example: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>SELECT cvv.strvalue, cvv.identifier FROM controlledvocabularyvalue cvv, datasetfieldtype ft WHERE cvv.datasetfieldtype_id = ft.id AND ft.name=&#39;language&#39;;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If not, make sure to apply the citation.tsv from Dataverse 6.3 first (wget <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.3/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/citation.tsv\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.3/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/citation.tsv</a>). As long as your existing language controlled vocab. values have the identifiers defined, extending the CV to the full iso639 list should be painless and should not result in the loss of any previously supported language codes. </p>\n<p>One real drawback of having this full list in citation.tsv is that citation block updates take much longer now.</p>",
