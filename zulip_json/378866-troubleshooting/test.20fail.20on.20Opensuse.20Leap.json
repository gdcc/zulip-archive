        "content": "<p>Hi all, just to inform you about a quirk we encountered when trying to compile, i.e. test dataverse (v5.14) on our systems. If you call \"mvn package\" on (linux) systems that don't contain any hostname except localhost in the /etc/hosts file the tests fail because of a call to java.net.InetAdress.getLocalHost(). The method throws an exception which is caught and \"null\" is returned from getDataverseSiteUrlStatic(). In \"DatasetVersion.java\" the return value is used e.g. in line 2016 \".add(\"url\", SystemConfig.getDataverseSiteUrlStatic())\" and leads to a failure. This is only the case for the tests, compiling only works fine. We use (Open)Suse so not an officially supported system. We just thought it might be good to let you know in case anybody else stumbles across.</p>",
