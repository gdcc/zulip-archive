(See Compressed Files.)- </li>\n<li>Extraction of metadata from FITS files. (See Astronomy (FITS).)- </li>\n<li>Creation of NcML auxiliary files (See NetCDF and HDF5.)- </li>\n<li>Extraction of a geospatial bounding box from NetCDF and HDF5 files (see NetCDF and HDF5) unless dataverse.netcdf.geo-extract-s3-direct-upload is set to true.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm wondering how much this will impact the users.  We do have astronomy data in FITS format.  Has anyone else reconfigured a regular s3 bucket to do direct-upload?  Any compaints?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Jamie</p>",
