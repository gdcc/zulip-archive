As a superuser, is there a way to receive an email notification whenever <em>any</em> dataset is published across the entire Dataverse instance?<br>\nWeâ€™re the maintainers of the BSC Dataverse, and weâ€™d like to be notified whenever a new dataset is published â€” not just those where we have a specific role (e.g., admin or curator) in a particular collection.<br>\nFrom what I understand, notifications are typically tied to user roles within specific datasets or collections. But is there an option or workaround that would allow superusers to receive publication notifications for all datasets in the instance? Thanks in advance! <span aria-label=\"folded hands\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"folded hands\">:folded_hands:</span></p>",
