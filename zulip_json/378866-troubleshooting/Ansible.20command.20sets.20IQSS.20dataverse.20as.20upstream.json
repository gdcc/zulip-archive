We are working on deploying our own Dataverse, and wanted to check on best practices for one component of the script (highlighted portion in screenshot).</p>\n<p>It looks like the default is merging with the latest IQSS Dataverse code when it's run, which we've noticed can cause issues if our version is behind.
