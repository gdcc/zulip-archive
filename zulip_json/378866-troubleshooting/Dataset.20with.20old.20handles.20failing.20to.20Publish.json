I came here to start a new topic but found this similar one. We were using handles in v3 and have quite a number of datasets from back then. Recently our users having issues while publishing a new version of dataset with handles. <br>\nI am assuming it broke after 6.2 implementation of multiple PID providers. We have only one legacy PID provider defined and I am thinking dataset with handles is also trying to update DOI!</p>",
