We would like to preserve the DOI (of course!), but the instances have different DOI prefixes. I tried the <a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.2/developers/dataset-migration-api.html\">Migrate API</a> in a test environment, and this only worked if the PID in the JSON file has the same Prefix.  This is as indicated in the docs.</p>\n<p>\" existing publication dates and PIDs are maintained (currently limited to the case where the PID can be managed by the Dataverse software, e.g. where the authority and shoulder match those the software is configured for)\" </p>\n<p>But I was wondering, since Dataverse now supports multiple PID providers, would the migration API  work if we added the other DOI prefix (not as default, but as a second PID provider)? <br>\nCan you add DataCite twice as a PID provider, but with a different prefix?</p>\n<p>Any thoughts or advice?</p>\n<p>Laura</p>",
