I could not get it to stay up for more than 20 minutes .. we do have our site going through CloudFlare with some basic WAF rules and a rate limiting rule, but it wasn't enough .. so I ended up adding an AWS WAF rule to the load balancer to block bots .. however I think this may prove to be too aggressive .. anyone have any suggestions on the best way to control crawling? we are also currently blocking some known bad bots but only a few specific ones</p>",
