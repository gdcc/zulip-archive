On the \"My Data\" page (when you're logged in), if you select filter facets so that there are no search results, a message pops up saying \"Sorry, no results were found.\" This message is not translated when I switch the site to Dutch. </p>\n<p>The translation of this message is present in the <code>Bundle_nl.properties</code> file under <code>dataretrieverAPI.noMsgResultsFound</code>. I suspect the reason for the missing translation is that this message text is taken directly from the API search results, and the API doesn't know about the site's current language.</p>\n<p>Is there perhaps a dataverse setting that I have missed that fixes this problem?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/Fo5qPTzK7IvO3JzPINuXkzkM/Screenshot-from-2025-07-16-10-13-42.png\">Screenshot from 2025-07-16 10-13-42.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/Fo5qPTzK7IvO3JzPINuXkzkM/Screenshot-from-2025-07-16-10-13-42.png\" title=\"Screenshot from 2025-07-16 10-13-42.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1195x318\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/53090/Fo5qPTzK7IvO3JzPINuXkzkM/Screenshot-from-2025-07-16-10-13-42.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
