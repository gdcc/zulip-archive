A colleague of mine has been testing with these kind of files, and found the following.</p>\n<p>If a restricted Excel file, with variable information is uploaded, these variables are saved in the file metadata. <br>\nWhen you search for this variable, it pops up in the search result. We think this should not be happening, because access to the file is restricted. Is this assumption correct?<br>\nOr is it intended behaviour, because metadata is always searchable?</p>\n<p>My colleague also found out that in the DDI-export, variables for restricted files are not in the export.  This is what we would expect.  However, in the Croissant export, these variables are present. Should I report this a a bug?</p>",
