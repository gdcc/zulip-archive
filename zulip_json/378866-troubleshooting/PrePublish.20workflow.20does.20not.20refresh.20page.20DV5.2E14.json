        "content": "<p>Dear DV community,  after upgrading to Dataverse version 5.14, our PrePublish workflow does not work as expected any more (as it did with version 5.12.1). If a PrePublish workflow is activated, the dataset  page is not refreshed after clicking the publish button. This happens both when we do an http request to an external API in the workflow as well as when we just have two log steps in the workflow configuration without any pause or http request. The workflow runs and finishes fine, just the dataset page is not refreshed, and for the user it seems that nothing happens. Only after a manual refresh of the dataset page, the dataset page is presented as expected.  This behaviour is also reported in an old issue <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/7716\">7716</a>. Does anyone else have the same issue or has an idea? See attached file for the workflow configuration. Thanks and best, Doro<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/ZSeEZmwDgKMy6E302ry-A25t/workflow.json\">workflow.json</a></p>",
