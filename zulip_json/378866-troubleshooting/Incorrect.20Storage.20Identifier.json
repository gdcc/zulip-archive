Sherry's notes indicated that deleting it from within the UI would require a re-upload of the file so will try to avoid that since the person uploading this 3D data is so far behind I dont want them to have to backtrack with a re-upload. Would updating the persistent identifier and md5 in the DB table and re-indexing also be a workable solution? Seem low friction unless there is another element that needs updating that I am not aware of...</p>",
