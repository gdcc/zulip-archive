I found two solutions: using other kinds of compressions (such as .tar.gz), or double compression (.zip.zip). None of them are acceptable for them for different reasons. I do not see any other options in the user interface or in the API. We use currently v6.2. Do you have any suggestion?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help,<br>\nPÃ©ter</p>",
