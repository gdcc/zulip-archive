The depositor has a custom role: the contributor role + ManageFilePermissions. So the depositor can't publish, but can grant/reject access requests. <br>\nOther roles do receive the access request notification, so my guess is that the notification is not sent to users with only the ManageFilePermission bit, but only to the ones with 'ManageDatasetPermissions'?</p>\n<p>Does someone here has more info?<br>\nDoes the <a href=\"http://demo.dataverse.org\">demo.dataverse.org</a> instance has this feature enabled, so I can test it?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nLaura</p>\n<p>PS. My first Zulip message, I hope this is in the right place.</p>",
