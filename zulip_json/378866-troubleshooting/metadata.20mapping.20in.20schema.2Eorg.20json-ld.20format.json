I've got a question about the metadata mapping of the funding information in the export format <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a> JSON-LD. <br>\nAccording to the Dataverse metadata crosswalk the funding agency is already included in this export format but the grant identifier isn't. As far as I can see the <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a> property \"funding\" would be quite well-suited for this (<a href=\"https://schema.org/funding\">https://schema.org/funding</a>). Are there any plans to include this metadata field in the <a href=\"http://schema.org\">schema.org</a> json-ld metadata export in one of the following Dataverse releases? And if not, is there any documentation on how we might be able to configure the metadata mapping by ourselves to include it?  <br>\nMany thanks! <br>\nKatharina @Heidelberg University (heiDATA)</p>",
