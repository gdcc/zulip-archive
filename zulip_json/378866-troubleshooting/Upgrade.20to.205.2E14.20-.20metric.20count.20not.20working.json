As <a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/api/metrics.html\">https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/api/metrics.html</a> explains, the values are cached, though. I supposed you'd have to set the <a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/installation/config.html#metricscachetimeoutminutes\">cache timeout</a> to a low value to test.</p>",
