I just tried it for like 5 minutes or so.</p>\n<p>Opening the browser is <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html#webbrowser.open\">possible</a>, but transferring something out of the browser without a cooperating website is difficult, as you would need to allow and trigger a callback URL like <code>http://localhost:9473/login-callback</code>, so this would require implementation efforts on Dataverse's side, unless they already support a similar callback for OIDC one could re-use.</p>\n<p>However, in general Dataverse seems to support this kind of authentication (and pyDataverse kind of as well in <a href=\"https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse/pull/201\">https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse/pull/201</a>, as that adds support for Bearer tokens), although it expects authentication to happen out-of-band: <a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/remote-users.html\">https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/remote-users.html</a> . So if you use Shibboleth, Keycloak, or another OIDC provider, you can handle this use case by first logging in (potentially with any OIDC Python library) and using that token in BearerTokenAuth(...) in <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/201\">#201</a>.</p>\n<p>In general, all this should considered as part of <em>Phase 3</em> in <a href=\"https://py.gdcc.io/\">https://py.gdcc.io/</a> , especially when integrating DVCLI.</p>\n<p>For Signed URLs, I started a longer discussion here: <a href=\"https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse/issues/200\">https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse/issues/200</a>, and I am not sure those will solve the problem at hand as their use case is somewhat different.</p>",

However, since Dataverse only allows a single API token (and this one will be rotated with the recreation request), this will cause problems if you use your API token in multiple services. I didn't find another API endpoint to actually retrieve a (new) token.<br>\nI was about to try it though with the recreate (which would make the (local) test setup for pyDataverse much easier) and found another edge-case we should support in pyDataverse: Currently <a href=\"http://demo.dataverse.org\">demo.dataverse.org</a> is in maintenance mode and returns a 200 status code with a big html for every API call... I think this should maybe be a 503 status code, but well. I stored the html locally and will see if we can make that work in the error handling.</p>\n<p>Do you know how to call the users/token/recreate path? In the browser it's some very tricky POST call to the <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/dataverseuser.xhtml\">http://localhost:8080/dataverseuser.xhtml</a> which only works because at that point I already have a session cookie.<br>\nI tried it with POST to /users/token/recreate, /api/users/token/recreate, /api/v1/users/token/recreate and directly to dataverseuser.xhtml similar to what the web UI does. I tried the following form data:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>loginForm:credentialsContainer:0:credValue = username\nloginForm:credentialsContainer:1:sCredValue = password\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but it didn't work.
