Huge bummer!</p>\n<p>Luckily the current pyDataverse 0.4.0 implementation simply uses their base class to implement necessary methods, but not the entire eco-system. Hence, I can restore compatibility by simply not inheriting and removing the dependency (see <a href=\"https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse/actions/runs/21987619496/job/63525807148\">completed</a> vs <a href=\"https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse/actions/runs/21986071898\">failed</a> run).</p>\n<p>I am now looking into alternatives, since other users have experienced the same issues. One of which is <a href=\"https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">fsspec</a> which looks very promising. What are your thoughts? To me it looks like it is a viable alternative and possibly offers even more.</p>",
