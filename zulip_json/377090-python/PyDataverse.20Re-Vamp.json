I've been experimenting with a couple of OpenAPI client-code generators and found that <a href=\"https://www.speakeasyapi.dev\">speakeasy</a> provides the most stable and user-friendly solution.</p>\n<p>Tested it with my app EasyReview in a CI pipeline. Once the OpenAPI schema of EasyReview changes, the SDK is re-generated automatically. You can find both repositories here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/JR-1991/easyReview\">EasyReview</a> - Parent repo<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/JR-1991/python-easyreview/tree/main\">python-easyreview</a> - Python SDK repo </p>\n<p>The generated SDK works perfectly! Additionally, the generation can be customized quite well (sub-structures, namespaces etc.) via the OpenAPI document. Apart from Python, you can also generate Typescript SDKs, which could be interesting for <code>dataverse-js</code> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"598442\">@Guillermo Portas</span> </p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?
