I was thinking that depending on the size of the task, a single cell should be sufficient. Hence, one could simply copy the cell and proceed. This way we could put multiple operations into one notebook.</p>\n<p>For instance, a single notebook describes how you can handle a dataset from creation, editing and file uploads. You just pick what suits you and re-use the code snippet.</p>",
