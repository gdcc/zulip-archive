I am honored to be mentioned a few times during the presentation :-)) Next on our agenda is a write-up paper, and as I am brainstorming about it, I have a few questions:<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"598112\">@Philip Durbin</span> Do you know if any other repositories implement the geo-search as Dataverse does? I know Jim previously worked on it also, but what were the origins of the idea?<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"599841\">@Jan Range</span> Do any other repositories use the web previewer? Where was it developed?<br>\nIf you have other inputs on related work and repositories that support geospatial/high-dimensional features please let me know :)</p>",
