Our efforts resulted in a <a href=\"https://tdl-ir.tdl.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/12ed88f1-af02-4c79-83f9-cbf4c7255d1d/content\">limited pilot implementation</a> of a secondary larger data storage option for a select group of researchers. The TDR Steering Committee and the Texas Digital Library (TDL) would like to see this work broadened, refined by a developer, and adapted to an expanded service model.</p>\n<p>TDL has described the scope of work and funding <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bAvzWbc_s8uRzz_yMfhTKoI8r1N92LGjXr3ZKREJeEA/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>. We are seeking informal expressions of interest with timing and cost estimates for the work requested. TDL is committed to contributing to the OSS software rather than creating custom code that only applies to us. </p>\n<p>Please reach out to me, Courtney Mumma, TDL's Deputy Director, at <a href=\"http://\">c.m...@austin.utexas.edu</a>, with your questions and interest.</p>",
