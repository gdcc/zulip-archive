Instead we link to places in the API Guide where this or that task is described, such as uploading files.</p>\n<p>I like to think this page adds some value and it was quite easy to write up. Again, it's mostly pointers to content elsewhere (that may be hard to find). So! We COULD do this for \"how to upload and publish\" (via UI, of course) but it's just a thought. <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
