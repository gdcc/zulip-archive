I'm not sure if this is the right place to bring this up, but while reviewing the Dataverse documentation (<a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.4/user/\">https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.4/user/</a>), I noticed that some links are broken. The links under \"Supported Metadata\" in the Appendix section seem to be non-functional: <a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.4/user/appendix.html\">https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.4/user/appendix.html</a>. For example, this link leads to a missing file: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/13HP-jI_cwLDHBetn9UKTREPJ_F4iHdAvhjmlvmYdSSw/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/13HP-jI_cwLDHBetn9UKTREPJ_F4iHdAvhjmlvmYdSSw/edit#gid=0</a> (Citation Metadata).</p>\n<p>It looks like the files referenced in this section may have been deleted. Could someone from this group help resolve this issue? Thanks in advance!</p>",

You can also view the entire model in the tsv in GitHub as linked on the page, the google sheet was the same thing, just in a google sheet. So, if you download the tsv and import in excel or google sheets, it should result in the same thing.</p>",
