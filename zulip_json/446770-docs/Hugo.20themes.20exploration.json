I won't be able to join February 21st, but here is a list of what I found as options to explore look-and-feel wise that I thought could be promising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/docsy/\">https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/docsy/</a> (demo: <a href=\"https://example.docsy.dev/\">https://example.docsy.dev/</a>): though meant for documentation, the homepage has a nice look and feel to it in line with earlier mock-ups.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/tailbliss/\">https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/tailbliss/</a> (demo: <a href=\"https://tailbliss.netlify.app/prose/\">https://tailbliss.netlify.app/prose/</a>): Simple, but clean and modern look</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/roxo-hugo/\">https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/roxo-hugo/</a> (demo: <a href=\"https://roxo-hugo.staticmania.com/portfolio\">https://roxo-hugo.staticmania.com/portfolio</a>): Also looks promising. Sub pages are very image-heavy compared to tailbliss.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/\">https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/</a> (demo: <a href=\"https://2019.devfesttoulouse.fr/\">https://2019.devfesttoulouse.fr/</a>): I think itâ€™s meant for conferences/events, but also looks promising layout and style-wise. The map also looks nice.</li>\n</ul>",
