It's not specific to one anchor, it occurs for multiple searches. I e.g. tested \"thumbnail\" as a search and opened a result in a new tab (using CTRL+click, using right click and select open in new tab opens it correctly). I've had this issue many times before, but never understood what was happening. It's a minor thing and maybe only windows specific, but maybe others have noticed this before too. Also not sure if it's fixable... <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span></p>",
