I'm repeating their call for implementation support, to help them find someone. So, if you're interested, or know someone, let them know, or you can reach out to me and I'll forward the message.</p>\n<p>In this context, they've posted the following, looking for someone to help with their implementation phase:</p>\n<p>Hi Dataverse community,</p>\n<p>Ghent University would like to run a project in collaboration with a number of other universities in Flanders, Belgium to set up and validate a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a multi-institutional Dataverse repository. To lead and coordinate the set-up on our infrastructure, documenting, testing and validating of the MVP,  we are looking for a temporary implementation manager with experience of successful implementation of a Dataverse repository for archiving &amp; sharing research data in a university (or similar research organisation), and ideally even of a single Dataverse instance that is used by multiple institutions.</p>\n<p>The temporary implementation manager would be responsible for delivering the intended project results (listed below) in close collaboration with IT, library and other staff at the universities of Ghent, Antwerp and Hasselt (these will participate as pilot institutions in the project): </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A functional MVP of a multi-institutional Dataverse repository installed on infrastructure chosen by us, and configured for the three pilot institutions in accordance with the MVP definition to be established in the project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Documentation of configurations, customisations and integrations implemented in the MVP</p>\n</li>\n<li>A report detailing relevant findings from the MVP phase regarding technical, financial, and organisational implications for a full-scale repository  service (e.g. initial operational costs and resource requirements)</li>\n<li>Documented recommendations and a roadmap for scaling up/further developing the MVP to  an operational repository service for participating institutions, if the MVP is successfully validated</li>\n<li>Appropriate communication actions to relevant stakeholders  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tasks would include e.g. overall project management, providing advice on establishing the MVP definition, on installation and configuration and other aspects of implementation etc., and reporting.</p>\n<p>Also we would be looking for one person to guide the whole project in the right direction.</p>\n<p>The currently envisioned project run time is 12 months, with a preferred start date as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>We are seeking informal expressions of interest before launching an official recruitment procedure for a temporary implementation manager via a public sourcing platform.</p>\n<p>Perhaps someone in this community is interested in taking on this role, or could point us to someone who might be? Any other feedback is also welcome.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to me, Myriam Mertens (open science team lead at Ghent University Library) at  <a href=\"mailto:%20myriam.mertens@ugent.be\">myriam.mertens@ugent.be</a> with your suggestions, questions and/or interest.*</p>\n<p>For original message, see: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/3Kuk_t963L0\">https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/3Kuk_t963L0</a></p>",
