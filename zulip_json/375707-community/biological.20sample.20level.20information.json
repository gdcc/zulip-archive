Samples can be data, or laboratory samples. The framework integrates with Rightfield sheets, so that semantically-enhanced title sheets can be included with the data. The default Rightfield sheet uses the JERM and allows automatic generation and linking of the data files to an assay. Sample attributes can be limited to controlled vocabularies backed by an ontology.\" -- <a href=\"https://seek4science.org/features.html\">https://seek4science.org/features.html</a></p>",

Yes, you described it precisely - ideally researcher fills out an excel sheet, allowing to copy-paste, autofill, etc., which then should get ingested. Usually we will have ~10-20 samples associated with a dataset, sometimes more. Right now we handle each sample as a compound field, allowing multiples of the samples, and building an external tool which will provide excel-like functionality - because obviously, nobody will type 20 samples x 6-8 fields by hand...<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/9EhmWFVpZTa_Y0nwypQjxU4H/Screenshot-from-2025-09-10-14-20-48.png\">Screenshot from 2025-09-10 14-20-48.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/9EhmWFVpZTa_Y0nwypQjxU4H/Screenshot-from-2025-09-10-14-20-48.png\" title=\"Screenshot from 2025-09-10 14-20-48.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1555x1441\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/53090/9EhmWFVpZTa_Y0nwypQjxU4H/Screenshot-from-2025-09-10-14-20-48.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
