We will have a look at this but we are also currently working on next steps for this app, initially Ask The Data was designed as a prototype to showcase functionality like this but in the near future we are expecting users to have their own Ask The Data installations and this tool should be using this instance. </p>\n<p>Right now there are 2 issues that are concerning with the current way it works.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Possible time outs due the transport of the files across installations.</li>\n<li>It is required to have a OpenAI token for the Ask The Data \"service\" and because of this each installation should have their own billing and support for this.</li>\n</ol>",
