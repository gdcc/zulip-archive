Yes, I have seen that there is no problem about changing metadata without updating the version. <br>\nIn my opinion, the README file (or any explanation file, that is files that don't have the data) should be viewed as similar to metadata.<br>\nI think that is confusing to the users to upgrade the major version number when there is no change in the data (e.g. for a typo as said Vera Clemens previously).</p>",
