I think it's possible to do that, and that would be safer (tech-wise) than switching computers, I think.</p>\n<p>Alumni Hall has weird audio. There are mics and things that project to the room audience, but there's no tech to connect that to what streaming people are hearing, so we are planning to have our own room mics. The people watching virtually might or might not have trouble hearing the audio for the videos, but I'd hope that anything people in the room can hear, they'll be able to hear (maybe not as well, but to some degree).</p>",

But we <em>don’t want you to miss out.</em></p>\n<p>That’s why the virtual attendance option includes access to <strong>workshops on June 10</strong> and all the <strong>presentations, panels, and discussions throughout the week.</strong></p>\n<p>We encourage every organization, institution, or repository to purchase <strong>one virtual group ticket</strong> and bring your local community together to participate. Whether it’s a conference room, a cozy office, or a shared space, gather your people and be part of something bigger.</p>\n<p>The team has poured heart and soul into creating a meaningful, connected experience. With the reduced cost of virtual attendance, we hope this makes it easier for everyone to join us, even from afar.<br>\nWe need you there. Let’s make it a week to remember — together.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>The Dataverse Project</p>",
