It ends with Jim brining up BagIt.</p>\n<p>Finally, I long time ago I heard about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Data_Liberation_Front\">Data Liberation Front</a> at Google which has the goal of making it easier for users to move their data in and out of Google products. I aspire for the same thing for Dataverse. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
