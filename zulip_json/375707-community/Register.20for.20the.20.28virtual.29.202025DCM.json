But we <em>don’t want you to miss out.</em></p>\n<p>That’s why the virtual attendance option includes access to <strong>workshops on June 10</strong> and all the <strong>presentations, panels, and discussions throughout the week.</strong></p>\n<p>We encourage every organization, institution, or repository to purchase <strong>one virtual group ticket</strong> and bring your local community together to participate. Whether it’s a conference room, a cozy office, or a shared space, gather your people and be part of something bigger.</p>\n<p>The team has poured heart and soul into creating a meaningful, connected experience. With the reduced cost of virtual attendance, we hope this makes it easier for everyone to join us, even from afar.<br>\nWe need you there. Let’s make it a week to remember — together.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>The Dataverse Project</p>",
