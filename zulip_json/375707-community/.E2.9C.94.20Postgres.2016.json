I thought the recommendation was still for 13 but I see in the installation docs 16 is recommended. I know community support ends in Nov. Should we just go ahead and upgrade?

You are encouraged to start planning your upgrade and may want to review the <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v5.4\">Dataverse 5.4 release notes</a> as the upgrade process (e.g. <code>pg_dumpall</code>, etc.) will likely be similar.
