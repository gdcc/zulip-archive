In order to request access to the restricted file, a user must have an account on the system, is that correct?   Is that the only way someone could get access to a restricted file?  Makes sense if it is (view access permitted to that user, I'm guessing), but I wanted to confirm if that's the case. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
