I'm trying to fully understand how it would enrich our metrics, aside from adding in citations  For the views and downloads, what exactly changes with those numbers?   </p>\n<p>I know, for example, that the classic counts do not weed out bots, but the MDC ones do?   The MDC Dataverse documentations says that out of the box you get \"Classic download counts\", but what I'm trying to understand is the specific changes we'd see in those by enabling MDC. </p>\n<p>Is a major part of the benefit of this is that DataCite can then show statistics as well? </p>\n<p>I guess I'm trying to understand what this is really adding to our setup.  </p>\n<p>Thanks so much!<br>\nBethany</p>",
