I'd like to share the results of some benchmarking I've been doing to help track and report the progress of changes we made to Harvard Dataverse earlier this year in order to increase amount of ORCIDs and RORs in metadata in the repository. The report's in a Google Doc at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtiAdR-p9BldPx8sdowGk7DMcu9IFlgR9BD0FufloQQ\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtiAdR-p9BldPx8sdowGk7DMcu9IFlgR9BD0FufloQQ</a>.</p>\n<p>I also shared this in the Dataverse Users Community Google Group, in a thread at <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/dataverse-community/c/fHS04ccPMhc\">https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/dataverse-community/c/fHS04ccPMhc</a>.</p>\n<p>The changes included the use of the <a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/metadatacustomization.html#using-external-vocabulary-services\">\"external controlled vocab\" feature</a> to let users choose author names and affiliations suggested from the ORCID and ROR APIs, and to let users add ORCIDs to their accounts so that those ORCIDs are added to those users' deposits. I think the successes shown by the benchmarking might also encourage folks managing other Dataverse repositories to consider these features, too.</p>",
