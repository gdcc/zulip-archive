We are aware of the possibility to implement a virus scanning step in a pre-publication workflow, but that would be a little bit too late, since unpublished data might also be shared between users having sufficient access. Has someone implemented a virus scan on upload, maybe using clamav. A completely different way could be to inspect the ingoing network traffic, but a solution within Dataverse,  producing a meaningful and understandable error message and as the icing on the cake an email alert to certain persons seems favorable...</p>",
