We are considering directing our researchers to use Harvard Dataverse as an alternative. However, for datasets already preserved in Dataverse NC that have existing DOIs, assigning a new DOI through migration to Harvard Dataverse would lead to duplicate DOIs, which we want to avoid.</p>\n<p>Do you have any suggestions on handling these datasets to maintain DOI integrity? Thank you!</p>",

I like your idea of creating a harvesting “set” to facilitate easy data transfer between Dataverse instances. My institution prioritizes Open Science Framework (OSF) that we already subscribe to and asked us to deposit data in OSF. Do you know whether the harvesting “set” works for OSF as well? Thanks!</p>",
