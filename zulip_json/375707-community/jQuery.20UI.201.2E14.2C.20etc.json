A lot of effort is currently put into moving away from JSF and PrimeFaces towards using a new frontend built in React. We try to not put too much effort into the \"old\" JSF frontend. That said, this security issue might be qualified for something we should look at.</p>\n<p>Of course it would be a lot easier when the community steps up and helps out. From a quick look at <a href=\"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces\">https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces</a> I see that there's now Primefaces v15. Would you feel up to the task of migrating Dataverse's JSF UI to this newer version? In the past, we had some bad experience with breaking changes between their major versions, so it might escalate quickly. Or not. Who knows...</p>\n<p>We're of course happy to guide you along the process of developing, testing and creating a contribution.</p>",

In their <a href=\"https://primefaces.github.io/primefaces/15_0_0/#/../migrationguide/12_0_0\">migration guide 11 to 12</a> they don't list any breaking changes.
