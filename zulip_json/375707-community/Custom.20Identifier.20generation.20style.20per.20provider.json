With great pleasure I learned the 6.2 is able to use multiple PID providers, which can be selected on Dataverse Collection level. For some reason outside my scope of decision we need custom PID generation styles per Dataverse collection.</p>\n<p>As  a far as  I understand <a href=\"https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#dataverse-pid-identifier-generation-style\">https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#dataverse-pid-identifier-generation-style</a>  correctly, there still can be just  one  generateIdentifierFromStoredProcedure() in the database, which makes it difficult to adapt the generation styles to pre-existing schemes.</p>\n<p>Is there any solution yet (meaning that I wasn't able to find the correct place in the docs) or is there a plan to add support for multiple database-stored functions?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for any info on that matter!</p>",
