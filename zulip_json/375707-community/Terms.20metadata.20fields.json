Some of the fields we'd like to use are in the terms[1]  category. </p>\n<p>Most of the metadata so far, except system fields, are part of a metadata block.  It appears that the terms metadata are built in.  Is that correct?  </p>\n<p>Mostly I'm trying to get a handle on what fields come from where and who can manage them (for example, what are system managed fields that we cannot edit?).   It seems that these term fields are defined in a different way, but are fields we can and will use to manage licensing/etc?  Could I think of these as Dataverse's base metadata data model (along with system managed fields) and all the metadata blocks are adding on to this? </p>\n<p>Thanks!  </p>\n<p>[1] terms tab in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAhZ83hKURX_4T-bOkn7XCb9h62Gr2gcJI1fWe4Rl4c/edit?gid=1217395969#gid=1217395969\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAhZ83hKURX_4T-bOkn7XCb9h62Gr2gcJI1fWe4Rl4c/edit?gid=1217395969#gid=1217395969</a></p>",
