And we try to followÂ [http://semver.org](http://semver.org/)Â (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).</code> </p>\n<p>That was from 2016 and I was wondering if that's still the case - releases when there's enough new features/ fixed issues?  Do you still follow Semantic Versioning? <br>\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/xt2NtJpZlsk/m/xAPe51BHCwAJ\">https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/xt2NtJpZlsk/m/xAPe51BHCwAJ</a></p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nBethany</p>",

For example, team members established a release theme (e.g., addressessing pull requests and issues focused on a specific feature or system upgrade) or they determined that a critical mass of code improvements had been made to warrant a release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, as the Dataverse Community has grown and the Dataverse Project team have taken on more grant-funded work the limitations of the ad hoc approach have become more clear. Dataverse Community members have asked for greater transparency about the timing and contents of releases. In addition, scheduling the design, implementation, and deployment of time-sensitive software improvements funded by different stakeholders has become necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moving from an ad hoc to a planned release strategy will help to address these stakeholder needs for better communication and development planning support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
