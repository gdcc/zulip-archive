We are rolling out slowly with a small number of beta testers and gathering feedback on the service. From our call today, it sounds like the approach of embedding a Javascript snippet on landing/download pages might not immediately work for Dataverse installations, which is very helpful feedback for us to consider for future iterations <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

There is also the Data Metrics Badge: <a href=\"https://support.datacite.org/docs/displaying-usage-and-citations-in-your-repository\">https://support.datacite.org/docs/displaying-usage-and-citations-in-your-repository</a> which similarly displays all three.</p>\n<p>Citation metadata can come from a variety of sources, including DataCite and Crossref DOI metadata. We're also expanding the sources of citations through the work on the Open Global Data Citation Corpus (<a href=\"https://makedatacount.org/data-citation/\">https://makedatacount.org/data-citation/</a>). However, citations can't be derived from web usage (the same way that, for example, views can be derived from page hits), so collecting citation information is not part of the usage tracker. I hope that helps to clarify the scope of the service!</p>",
