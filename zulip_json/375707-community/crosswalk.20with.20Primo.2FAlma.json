I see that Jaime (or LSP dev) responded with some info on the Alma side .. was that helpful? </p>\n<p>Her response (if it helps anyone else): \"We have a very basic OAI DC discovery import profile set up in Alma. The dc:identifier is a DOI or handle so we use that for linking. We add the resource type and Open Access icons via normalization. We have been basing the OA icons on the value of dc:type, but that field is now hard-coded in the OAI feed so we need an alternative way to identify which datasets are open access via the OAI data. \" </p>\n<p>We aren't sure what the solution is yet for what we will use instead of dc:type but are looking at options like using Datacite or a different feed. Let us know how it is going with you! Also, if you have any other questions for Jaime.</p>",
