I've been searching for open-source / self-hostable data <em>publishing</em> platforms all week and just got around to checking out Dataverse and reviewing the installation guide. Sounds feasible. One question if I may: is there a visual backend  / GUI of any kind (and screenshots of that) or is all the data ingress script-based? The project I'm working on for what it's worth: gathering together open-source data about impact investing and sustainable finance with the idea of helping it gain visibility (the project is a personal initiative. I work for a non profit). <a href=\"https://github.com/danielrosehill/ImpactDatabase\">https://github.com/danielrosehill/ImpactDatabase</a></p>",

That's exactly what I intended. The backend is ... what I'm looking at here, right? And one quick question: is there a way to disable account creation (as in via a self-service mechanism)? By which I mean: the data publishing platform I'm looking at building isn't collaborative in the sense that (for boring compliance reasons but mostly to make sure somebody doesn't upload data that would be problematic to host), I would be the only admin. Is that a \"posture\" that can be configured? Looks like a great tool!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/wLmhmOXLBh7MqGP7uWHKwYo9/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/53090/wLmhmOXLBh7MqGP7uWHKwYo9/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/53090/wLmhmOXLBh7MqGP7uWHKwYo9/image.png\"></a></div>",
