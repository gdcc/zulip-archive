One of our goals is to publish datasets via Dataverse, and Iâ€™ve recently become responsible for managing our Dataverse server.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve been learning a lot on the fly â€” working with an existing Payara setup, reading the documentation, and trying to understand upgrade procedures, configuration files, etc. While Iâ€™m making progress, I donâ€™t yet feel confident handling the server on my own and would really appreciate any guidance or tips from those with more experience.</p>\n<p>Are there any good resources (guides, checklists, best practices, etc.) focused more on the <em>system administration/configuration side</em> of Dataverse? I saw there are some training resources for end users, but nothing focused on managing Payara, deployment processes, or troubleshooting in production environments.</p>\n<p>Also, if anyone here has experience upgrading Dataverse between versions (weâ€™re going from 6.0 to 6.7), Iâ€™d love to hear how you handled it, especially any lessons learned or things to watch out for.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance! Iâ€™m excited to learn and contribute as I go. <span aria-label=\"blush\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60a\" role=\"img\" title=\"blush\">:blush:</span></p>",
