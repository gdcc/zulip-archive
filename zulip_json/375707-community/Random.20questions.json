(i think yes because the download count increases when i view <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span> )<br>\n2) is there a way to disable tabular file ingest for a dataset? don't think so? only at site level and/or file type</p>\n<p>thanks!</p>",
