I don't think I have any particular insight to share for your three points but I'm curious... what subsection of datasets are you interested in? Maybe by looking at a few of these datasets we'll get some ideas of how we might visualize them.</p>",

I'm particularly interested in legal datasets, especially those related to the Caselaw Access Project. However, I'm open to exploring other datasets that might benefit from WebXR visualization.</p>\n<p>I'd love to discuss this further and perhaps look at some specific datasets together. Would you be available for a brief e-meeting before the Thursday morning working group session? I'm planning to attend that as well, but a one-on-one conversation could be really helpful in shaping my approach.</p>\n<p>If you're open to it, I could share my screen and show you some of my initial ideas for WebXR visualization. Your insights would be invaluable in refining my concept and understanding how it might best serve the Dataverse community. Let me know if you have any availability, and I'll be happy to work around your schedule.</p>",
