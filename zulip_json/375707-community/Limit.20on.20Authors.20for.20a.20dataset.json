The depositor hasn't directly asked me to include all the authors, but as far as I can tell, there isn't a limit on number of author entries, correct? Even if there isn't a limit on the total number of authors, I would imagine there are practical reasons that one would not enter all 50 authors. If anyone has advice on this topic and what a practical limit on the number of authors should be, please let me know.</p>",
