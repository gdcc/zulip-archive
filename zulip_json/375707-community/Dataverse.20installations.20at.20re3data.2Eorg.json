I found that a significant number of Dataverse installations are not yet listed on <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a>. (While you have 137 on your list, at <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a> 222 repositories report to use Dataverse: <a href=\"https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&amp;software%5B%5D=Dataverse\">https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&amp;software%5B%5D=Dataverse</a>)</p>\n<p>My findings are documented in this table, which presents the JSON data in tabular form. The results of the comparison are shown in the last column:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAyDYDJ0MVP3Ibhtvf337r3qQY2GQZtM1hwR2VbbY_M/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAyDYDJ0MVP3Ibhtvf337r3qQY2GQZtM1hwR2VbbY_M/edit?usp=sharing</a> </p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s how to interpret the entries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For 86 installations I could suggest an identifier from <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a> (r3d...)</li>\n<li>\"no OAI-PMH\": The installation does not provide access via OAI-PMH. This may (but doesnâ€™t necessarily) mean itâ€™s not listed on <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a>. I only checked installations against <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a> if I found an endpoint.</li>\n<li>OAI-PMH endpoint links: These installations were not found on <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a>.</li>\n<li>\"???\": The installation was not online at the time of access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some thoughts based on my findings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since Iâ€™m particularly interested in OAI-PMH endpoints, it might be useful to include this information in your dataâ€”although it often can be inferred.</li>\n<li>Including the <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a> identifier in the Dataverse data could encourage institutions with new installations to register their repositories.</li>\n<li>For Dataverse users, some guidance on how to register with <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a> would be helpful. Ideally, this would include naming the software (Dataverse), mentioning the use of the DDI metadata standard, and specifying the OAI-PMH endpoint (if enabled). These are just the features I focus on, but I imagine thereâ€™s a broader set of common characteristics across Dataverse installations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might consider discussing this with the team at <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data.org</a> (<a href=\"mailto:info@re3data.org\">info@re3data.org</a>). In my experience, they are very responsive. (I also provided them my list, because they might want to add some of the missing instances to the registry.)</p>",
