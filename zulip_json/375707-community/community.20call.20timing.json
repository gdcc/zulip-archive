We switched from every 2 weeks to every 4 weeks, for example.</p>\n<p>Instead of having two calls in April we are planning to have the next call on Tuesday, May 28th (at the usual time, 10 Boston time). Yes, this is actually 8 weeks between calls. Sorry!</p>\n<p>To prevent this situation in the future, we should probably switch to something like the first Tuesday of the month.</p>\n<p>If we do this, the first Tuesday, I would suggest canceling the June call since it would only be a week after the previous call.</p>",
