The tool needs to act on behalf of the logged-in user and therefore requires the userâ€™s Dataverse API key. From what I found so far, Dataverseâ€™s External Tools integration only targets files and datasets, and there doesnâ€™t appear to be a way â€” even with an admin account â€” to retrieve usersâ€™ API keys via the API.</p>\n<p>One alternative I considered is using Keycloak (SSO) and bearer tokens flag, but my understanding is that that approach is currently experimental (temporary) and not recommended for production.</p>\n<p>Am I missing an existing documented method, or are there better recommended approaches for this use case? Any suggestions.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nOussama</p>",
