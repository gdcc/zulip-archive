        "content": "<p>Hello, <br>\nI'm trying to understand how Dataverse manages metadata. I understand at a high and maybe medium level about metadata blocks and how to add custom ones.  </p>\n<p>I'm trying to figure out how the system thinks about metadata it distributes when exporting via the UI or harvesting.  For example, when you export metadata, say in DDI format, will I only get the fields that are part of DDI across all metadata blocks?   Or in DC, will I only get the field if it has a DC termURL in the tsv file?   Basically I'm trying to figure out how the system picks which fields to export, per export format. </p>\n<p>We've enabled a OAI-PMH harvesting client and are using it to harvest oai_ddi format.  What I understand from that is that we'd get DDI fields.  What I don't understand about that is what fields exactly do we get from from the server we are harvesting from?  </p>\n<p>Sorry if this is a basic question.  I'm new to DDI - so I may have some basic misunderstandings there.   Thanks, in advance, for any help.</p>",
