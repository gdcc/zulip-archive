The code <a href=\"https://github.com/scholarsportal/dataverse-globus\">here</a> looks the same, so does that just mean I need to reconfigure the dataverse options? (ie: can i use the dataverse-globus code that we already have installed?) Also, does anything need to change in our S3 globus app/guest collection? I understand i will need to change the dataverse config to use a globus store now instead of the original db options but trying to sift through what other changes I will need to make.</p>",
