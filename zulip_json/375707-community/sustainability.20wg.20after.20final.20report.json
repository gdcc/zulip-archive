The idea is to see if there should be a new group around this at some point to continue with the next phase, but that's up to the GDCC steering group. So, I'll move it to inactive (for now, perhaps) with a PR. I will add the run-time, because I think that might be helpful in general. Do we have runtimes of the other inactive groups?</p>",
