How can I add more portuguese words, locally, to this version of translation file. After translation I intend to contribute to dataverse translation with the resulting file.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nAdÃ­lia Alves</p>",

For example, there is no pt_PT equivalent for <a href=\"https://github.com/GlobalDataverseCommunityConsortium/dataverse-language-packs/blob/dataverse-v5.12.1/en_US/staticSearchFields.properties\">staticSearchFields.properties</a>, and there might be keys in the files that are not there in portuguese.<br>\nHope this helps :)</p>",
