(I mean, released for production use) We are still in the initial phase of developing the MVP of the SPA.</p>\n<p>It may be a good time to consider right to left support in the SPA, since we are now defining the initial UI components and their behavior, but this would affect the scope of the MVP, which is to replicate part of the existing functionality, not add new one (Sticking to the initial planning, this would be a Post-MVP project). </p>\n<p>We need to understand how the right to left support fits into the SPA development timeline. We can talk about this at the weekly frontend meeting tomorrow. I would like to know what Stefano thinks about this.</p>\n<p>On the other hand (And this is more for the future), while changing the button orientation seems simple, I would ask for some mockups or wireframes before development.</p>",
