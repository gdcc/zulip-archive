        "content": "<p>Dear community,</p>\n<p>We have recently enabled the 3D preview feature and noticed that when uploading an .OBJ file, the system does not detect it correctly and instead displays it as a .TIFF. However, the file is displayed correctly when modifying it directly in the database. Based on this, we have created a script that could resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>However, our users would like to combine .OBJ files (for the 3D model) with .MTL files (for textures), but we see that the preview does not render correctly.</p>\n<p>Has anyone developed a solution for this or worked on a similar issue? Could it be that we have not applied the code correctly?</p>\n<p>Apologies if this has been asked before. We would really appreciate any insights!</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>Mireia AlcalÃ¡</p>",
