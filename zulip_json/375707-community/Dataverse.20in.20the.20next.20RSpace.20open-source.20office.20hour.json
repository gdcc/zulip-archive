If anyone from the Dataverse community is working on related projects or has ideas for RSpace:Dataverse workflows, we'd be happy to hear from you - just let me know.</p>\n<p>Sign up here: <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/83141ffc-39a0-49c0-a2d1-489801b7fcfe@b01eeac5-a192-4621-90cb-b956e9ac5e26\">https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/83141ffc-39a0-49c0-a2d1-489801b7fcfe@b01eeac5-a192-4621-90cb-b956e9ac5e26</a></p>\n<p>Would be great to see some of you there!</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nTilo</p>",
