I am aware that dataset metadata can be customized through metadata blocks. However, in my case I would also like to know whether it is possible to customize the metadata of a Dataverse itself â€” for example, by adding new fields in addition to the default ones (Dataverse name, identifier, email, etc.).</p>\n<p>I could not find anything related to this in the official documentation. If this is not currently supported, do you know of any possible workarounds?</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nOussama</p>",
