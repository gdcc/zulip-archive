I use it for pyDataverse since it’s widely adopted in the Python community.</p>\n<p>I just came across Docusaurus, and at first glance, it looks fantastic! The MDX integration is an excellent feature that provides a lot of flexibility. While you can embed HTML/JS into Markdown files with MkDocs, it sometimes feels a bit clunky. For <a href=\"http://Dataverse.org\">Dataverse.org</a>, I’d personally prefer Docusaurus over MkDocs because of its flexibility and more polished appearance.</p>",

It was straightforward at first, but when we wanted to make structural changes, it became a real challenge. That’s why we’re transitioning to MkDocs now.
