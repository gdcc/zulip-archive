        "content": "<p>Hello, <br>\nAt Johns Hopkins University, we are likely going to be permitting restricted files in our <a href=\"https://archive.data.jhu.edu/\">Repository</a> in the coming year. Thus far, we only accept data that can be open. We've been going to various compliance offices at our institution and getting feedback on our proposed workflow. </p>\n<p>One outcome of these discussions lead to a desire by some stakeholders to have the \"Terms of Access for Restricted Files\" automatically download as a text file when someone downloads the associated restricted file. The concern was that the pop-up box in the UI where you accept the terms is hard to read and therefore likely overlooked by the downloader. </p>\n<p>I couldn't find an existing ticket for this exact issue, though I found a related feature request <a href=\"https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/11459\">https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/11459</a>. <br>\nIf this is something that others would see as value to the community, I am happy to proceed with making a formal feature request in GitHub. </p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nBetsy</p>",

The assumption being people are too lazy to use the scroll bar to review it all <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span>.  So, perhaps using some CSS magic could solve this problem without the requirement of having the license text automatically download? </p>\n<p>It isn't a  complete showstopper for our compliance offices. It was more of \"we would feel more comfortable\" situation . I should state that we are proposing to deposit low sensitivity data, not the kind of data that contains identifying information and requires the signing of official data use agreements. We are trying to keep the process as automated as possible.</p>",
