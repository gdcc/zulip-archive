This would allow users to explore datasets in 3D/VR environments through a browser, potentially enhancing data comprehension and analysis capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Project Overview</h2>\n<p>The proposed tool would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allow users to upload datasets and transform them into spatialized environments</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable interactive exploration of data in WebXR using A-Frame</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrate with existing Dataverse architecture and metadata</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support both desktop and VR headset viewing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why WebXR?</h2>\n<p>WebXR visualization could be particularly valuable for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Geospatial datasets that inherently have a 3D component</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complex multi-dimensional data that benefits from spatial representation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Datasets where relationships between variables are difficult to perceive in 2D</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Community Input Needed</h2>\n<p>To ensure this tool meets the needs of the Dataverse community, I've created a short survey to gather your input on priorities and requirements. Your feedback will directly shape the development of this tool.</p>\n<p>Survey link: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeA7CLIQmxjsEWEUbRGqGS637iZZ_lAGZ4Kt7R7cByESzmBLQ/viewform?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeA7CLIQmxjsEWEUbRGqGS637iZZ_lAGZ4Kt7R7cByESzmBLQ/viewform?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p>The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete, and your responses will help determine which data types to prioritize and what visualization features would be most valuable.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and input!</p>\n<p>Charity Everett</p>",
