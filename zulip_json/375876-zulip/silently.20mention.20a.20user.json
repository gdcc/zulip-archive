You want to @mention them so it's clear who you're talking about but you don't want to trigger a notification. You can use <code>@_somebody</code> instead of <code>@somebody</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, I'm notifying <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"599841\">@Jan Range</span> but not <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"598183\">Oliver Bertuch</span>. It looks a bit different (no @ in the latter case) but the names are still clickable.</p>\n<p>The docs are here: <a href=\"https://zulip.com/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user\">https://zulip.com/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user</a></p>",
